basic of c :
compiler se compose de ;
1/PREPROCESSOR: -E do not compile
* generate intermidiate file that is given to the compiler

a//remove comment 
b/include header files in source code
c/replace macro name with code or value

2/COMPILER:
* convert files generated by the preprocessor as an input  and generatez an assembly code
* convert c program as an assembly language
a-
3/ASSEMBLER: -s //dont run the assembler  replace with .s
*    convert assebly code to the object code
a- convert to machine code binary :0 & 1

4/LINKER:   gcc -c replace with .o //dont run the linker
*link our object code with library code & generate exe file
a-pls fichier rassemnler ds one file 
b-linker ces fichiers with libraries to form one file.exe

-o file :Place output in file file

The executable file will be named "a.out".
The object file will be named "source.o".
The assembler file will be named "source.s".
The precompiled header file will be named "source.suffix.gch".
The preprocessed C source code will be output to the standard output.
